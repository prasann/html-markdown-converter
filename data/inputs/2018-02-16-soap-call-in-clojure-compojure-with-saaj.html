meta-description: Dealing with SOAP in clojure is not very straight-forward due to the lack of framework support. This post explains how to perform SOAP call using basic Java libraries.

  <h3>Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)</h3>
  <p>
    SOAP brings its own protocol and focuses on exposing pieces of application logic (not data) as services.
    SOAP is focused on accessing named operations, each implements some business logic through different interfaces. 
    This image below expresses the difference between a SOAP and normal REST/JSON endpoint very well.

  <h3>Soap With Attachment API for Java (SAAJ)</h3>
  <div>
      <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbhg.html">SAAJ</a> is a lower level API in Java that express SOAP messages. 
      Java developers rarely use SAAJ since the JAX WS and Spring WS provides better abstraction over SAAJ.

  <h3>SOAP in Clojure</h3>
  <h4>1. Prerequisite</h4>
  <p>As a one-time step, convert the WSDL into Java objects. This can be done using `wsimport` or `xjc`</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">xjc -wsdl wsdl-file-name</pre>
  or
  <pre class="prettyprint">wsimport wsdl-file-name</pre>
  <h4>2. Build SOAP Message</h4>
    <p>
      First step is to build a soap message with header and body. The root element of the SOAP body is one of the Java object created in the first step.
      Construct the Java object with the necessary data. Finally convert the SOAP Message into string.
    </p>
  <h4>3. Perform POST</h4>
  <p>A simple HTTP POST need to be performed with <span class="inline">Content-Type</span> header set to <span class="inline">text/xml</span>. 
    This can be done using normal <span class="inline">clj-http</span> methods.Authentication should be covered ideally in the SOAP header.</p>
  <h4>4. Parse response into Java Object</h4>
  <p>Finally the response string has to be converted into a SOAP Message again. This is required to parse the SOAP Response Body into one of the generated object.</p>
