<div class="post">
  <p> <a href="https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware"> Redux middlewares</a> can be used for a variety of things. You can basically tap into a redux event and perform some action with it. 
    Logging and analytics are very common use cases for Redux middleware.</p>
  <p> In my case, I have a middleware component, that needs to be injected while initializing the Redux store.
    The middleware component will be served dynamically when the app loads. </p>
  <h3>Exporting the middleware component</h3>
  <p>
    This middleware detects a specific redux action and persist an information to the local storage.
    It's a custom middleware with a minimal change. This custom function takes in <span class="inline">middlewareAPI</span>
    as the parameter instead of having the state.
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  const persistInfo = middlewareAPI => next => (action) => {
    if (action.type === "SOME_ACTION") {
      const result = next(action);
      const state =
            JSON.stringify(middlewareAPI.getState().listen.value);
      window.localStorage.setItem('PERSIST_THIS_INFO', state);
      return result;
    }
    return next(action);
  };
  
  export default persistInfo;
  </pre>

  <h3>Loading the custom middleware</h3>
  <p>
    Here is a small utility function that can take in a custom middleware and initialize the store.
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  import { createStore, compose } from 'redux';
  import reducers from './reducers';
  
  
  class Store {
    constructor() {
      const composeEnhancers =
        typeof window === 'object' &&
        window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ ?
          window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__({}) : compose;

      this.store = createStore(reducers);
    }
  
    instance() {
      return this.store;
    }
  
    addMiddleware(middleware) {
      const middlewareAPI = {
        getState: this.store.getState,
        dispatch: action => this.store.dispatch(action),
      };
      this.store.dispatch = compose(middleware(middlewareAPI))(this.store.dispatch);
    }
  }
  export default new Store();
      
  </pre>

  <p>
    This is my store class with the store initialization happens in the constructor. Simply, importing this store class and calling the <span class="inline">addMiddleware</span>
    function it's possible to inject the custom middleware component to your redux store.
  </p>
