  <p>
    I had an AWS image which was created using an EC2 instance of size 8 GB. Whenever i try to launch an instance i
    usually change the storage size to something say 20 GB. But once the system is launched when i do a
  <pre class="prettyprint">df -h</pre>
  i still see 8 GB and not 20 GB.
  </p>
  <p>
    On further reading i understood i need to resize the disk size. So i did the same using
  <pre class="prettyprint">sudo resize2fs /dev/xvde1</pre>
  But i was getting the following error:
    <pre class="prettyprint"> The filesystem is already *** blocks long. Nothing to do!
</pre>
  </p>
  <p>Then to reolve this issue i have to perform the following steps.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SSH to the machine.</li>
    <pre class="prettyprint">fdisk /dev/xvde</pre>
    <li>You should be seeing this message.</li>

    <pre class="prettyprint">WARNING: DOS-compatible mode is deprecated. It's strongly recommended to switch off the mode (command 'c') and change display units to sectors (command 'u')</pre>
    <li>Enter 'u' to change display units</li>
    <li>Enter 'p' to view the current paritions.</li>
    <li>Enter 'd' to delete current partitions.</li>
    <li>Enter 'n' to create a new partition.</li>
    <li>Enter 'p' to set it as primary partitions.</li>
    <li>Enter '1' to set it as primary partitions.</li>
    <li>Set the desired space. If nothing is given the entire space is allotted.</li>
    <li>Enter 'a' to make it bootable.</li>
    <li>Enter '1' and 'w' to write and save the changes.</li>
    <li>Reboot the instance from AWS console.</li>
    <li>Now if you resize the parition it worked all fine.</li>
    <pre class="prettyprint">sudo resize2fs /dev/xvde1</pre>

  </ul>
  <p>Check the partition size, it should be all set with more space.</p>
